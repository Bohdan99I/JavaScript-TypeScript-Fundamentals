//Create a function generatePrimes that takes in a number n as an argument.
//This function should generate and return an array containing the first n prime numbers.

//Write another function isPrime that takes a number num as an argument and determines
//whether it's a prime number or not. This function should return true if the number
//is prime and false otherwise.

//Utilize these functions to generate an array of the first n prime numbers.
